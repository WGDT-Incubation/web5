3. **Configure environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/did_db
     DB_NAME=did_db
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
     CHAINCODE_INVOKE_API_URL=http://blockchain-service/api
     USER_ENROLL_API_URL=http://blockchain-service/enroll
     USER_ID=blockchain_user_id
     USER_SECRET=blockchain_user_secret
     TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
     TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
     TWILIO_FROM=your_twilio_number
     LOG_LEVEL=info
     FETCH_URL=http://external-api/edistrict
     ```

## üèÉ Running the Application

- **Development (with hot reload):**
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- **Production:**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm start
  ```
- **Directly (for quick start pm2 daemon):**
  ```bash
  npm run start-server
  ```



---


## üöÄ Deployment
- Use a process manager like PM2 or Docker for production deployments.
- Ensure all environment variables are set securely.
- Example (with PM2):
  ```bash
  pm2 start dist/index.js --name did-backend
  ```



## üîí Security
- All sensitive endpoints require JWT authentication.
- Never commit secrets or credentials to the repository.
- Use HTTPS in production.
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches.
